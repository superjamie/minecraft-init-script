minecraft-init-script by Super Jamie <jamie@superjamie.net>

This is an initscript to run a Minecraft or CraftBukkit server on CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu.

## Features ##

* Start, stop, restart CraftBukkit as a system service
* Automatic (via cron) and manual logfile rotation
* Automatic (via cron) and manual backups
* Backup compression and rotation (keeps 7 days worth of backups)
* Check latest Recommended Build and update to it if required
* Information display including Java path, current memory usage, current TCP connections

## Features I'm considering adding ##

* Simplified backup restoration
* Log security alerts emailed to admins via sendmail/postfix

## Supported Distributions ##

* CentOS 6, CentOS 5, Fedora 14 (probably works on Fedora Core 6 and later, untested)
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS

Other distros which use SysV Init or Upstart (Debian, Mint) will probably work.
Distros using systemd (Fedora 15+, Arch Linux, etc) will not work.

## Requirements ##

* screen, rsync
  (you may need to install these)
* bash, chkconfig or sysv-rc, coreutils, cronie, curl, diffutils, grep, initscripts, net-tools, procps, tar
  (these should all be installed by default)
* Oracle Java 7
* Enough disk space to save your map twice, plus another ~5 times for a week of compressed backup space.
  If your map is 1Gb then you probably need at least 7Gb, plus any space your plugins require and any additional backups you'll be making.

## Installation ##

As the root user:

* Install Sun Java (CentOS/Fedora)
  Download the RPM from http://www.java.com/
  yum localinstall jre-<version>.rpm
* Install Sun Java (Ubuntu)
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
* Confirm your JVM installation with
  java -version
* Create a new user with a home directory
  useradd -m bukkit
* Save the script as /etc/init.d/minecraft and make it executable
  chmod +x /etc/init.d/minecraft
* Allow the bukkit user to run the init script without needing root access
  Type `visudo` and add this line to the bottom:
  bukkit localhost=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/minecraft*
* Create an alias so you only have to type "minecraft" to run the script
  Add the following line to both root and bukkit's ~/.bashrc file:
  alias minecraft='/etc/init.d/minecraft'
* Start the server on system boot if desired (CentOS/Fedora)
  chkconfig --add minecraft
  chkconfig minecraft on
* Start the server on system boot if desired (Ubuntu)
  update-rc.d minecraft defaults

As the regular user, bukkit:

* Make the required paths
  mkdir -p ~/backups && mkdir -p ~/craftbukkit
* Put your craftbukkit.jar, world, plugins, server.properties, etc into ~/craftbukkit
* Create cron jobs to do regular backups and rotations around 4am
  Type `crontab -e` to open the cron interface and add the following
  0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup
  5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate
  15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups

## Usage ##

* Start the server
  minecraft start
* Stop the server
  minecraft stop
* Restart the server
  minecraft restart
* Back up the map and executable (the compressed backup is done when the .md5 file appears in the backup directory)
  minecraft backup
* Check the server is running with
  minecraft status
* Get some more info with
  minecraft info

  * CraftBukkit (pid 9037) is running...
